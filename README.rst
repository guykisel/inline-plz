Tired of reading through CI console logs to find your lint errors? Inline your lint messages in your diffs!

* Free software: ISC license

Github webhook bot
------------------

* https://github.com/guykisel/inline-plz-bot

Features
--------

* Run linters against your code and comment in your diffs at the failing lines
* Automatically run linters with reasonable default configs
* Easy to add new linter configurations

How to use
----------

::

  pip install inlineplz
  inline-plz --install --autorun


You probably want to run the above in a CI job, not in your regular development environment.

You'll also need to provide the following either in the command line or via environment variables:

* owner: the repo organization/owner
* repo: the repo name
* token: your auth token (encrypt this, don't put this in plaintext in any public configurations!)
* url: the url of your scm host
* interface: the type of scm host (such as github)

Dependencies:

* node.js / npm
* ruby / gem
* python / pip
* haskell / cabal

Configuration
-------------

Besides specifying options at the command line or in environment variables, you can also set them in a yaml file.
You can create a file in the root of your repo named ``.inlineplz.yml``

For example:

::

  ignore_paths:
    - node_modules
    - .tox
    - .git
  enabled_linters:
    - prospector
  disabled_linters:
    - markdownlint-cli
    - gherkin-lint

For more see the examples folder in the repo.


Known issues
------------

* Currently for Travis-CI usage, inline-plz only works for PRs within the original repo, not PRs from forks. This is because encrypted creds in Travis-CI configs are encrypted per repo, and cannot be decrypted in PRs from forks. You can work around this using the webhook bot at https://github.com/guykisel/inline-plz-bot
* Currently the inline-plz console output can print out some misleading stack traces
* Currently dependencies get installed globally unless you pre-create a virtualenv
* Commits directly to master are not currently supported - only PRs get linted

Contribute
----------

* Report bugs/suggest features
* Add/update docs
* Add support for more linters
